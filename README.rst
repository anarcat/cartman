cartman
=======

cartman allows you to create and manage your `trac` tickets from the
command-line, without the need to setup physical access to the Trac
installation. All you need is a ~/.cartmanrc file with the following::

    [trac]
    base_url = http://your.trac.install/
    username = tamentis
    password = sitnemat
